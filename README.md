## Overview
Broadcast data from your R package to the world

## Installation
You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("humaniverse/broadcast")
```

## Usage
Call `broadcast::broadcast()` in the root directory of your R package to
broadcast .rda files from your `data/` folder into .csv files in a folder called
`.broadcast`. Alternative paths can be supplied using the arg `from`. An
optional file called `.broadcastignore` can be specified in the `.broadcast`
folder to ignore broadcasting certain file types. This additional file should
use the same syntax as `.gitignore`.
